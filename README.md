  Those who know me will know that I’ve been on a mission for the past half-year to learn as much as I can about data analytics and geospatial analysis. As a former student of anthropology and environmental studies, the ability of tools like Python and GIS to convert research observations into something with deep and overarching meaning is fascinating to me.

  In my quest to explore the world of data analytics, I’ve been talking to anyone and everyone I can find with a data-centric career path. And, from data engineers to GIS developers, the one thing I’ve heard over and over again is that ‘It doesn’t matter how good you are at analyzing data if you can’t tell a story with it.’ Put another way, you can have the cleanest data, develop the best analysis workflow, and uncover the most riveting insights, but if there isn’t a way to make these insights understandable to an interdisciplinary audience then your data isn’t reaching its full potential. This is one of many reasons that I’m fascinated with ArcGIS Online. ArcGIS Online (or AGOL for short) provides a streamlined platform to visualize and share geographic data via Web Maps. With the addition of AGOL Story Maps and Web Apps, you can combine maps with text, images, and other media to flesh out insights and tell an immersive story through geographic data. As Joseph Kerski put it in his Environmental GIS course, ArcGIS Online has facilitated the “transition [of GIS] from a set of tools into a platform that people can build on.” In short, ArcGIS Online is a powerful storytelling platform because it provides a means for people to analyze, visualize, and share geographic data. 

  Naturally, my social sciences, geography nerd, story-obsessed brain was hooked by AGOL. I’ve been itching to put together a cohesive project on the platform and play with some of its functionality for a while now. Inspired by a recent trip to Scotland, I’ve decided that Scottish history, social trends, and environmental factors provide the perfect subject to explore via web mapping. To that end, I’ve created an AGOL Web App with a few maps showcasing data stories from around Scotland. I hope you enjoy not only the technical aspects of the maps but the trends themselves that underpin this fascinating country. 

#### Skills used in the making of this Web App:
* Identifying and accessing open data sources
* Researching and citing additional sources
* Symbology and map design
* Data storytelling
* AGOL Web Maps
* AGOL Web Apps
